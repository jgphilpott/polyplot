# Intro

[Polyplot](https://www.polyplot.app) is a data exploration application inspired by [Ola Rosling](https://github.com/olarosling)'s [Trendalyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trendalyzer) software. In March 2007 Trendalyzer was acquired by Google and is now available online as [Google Public Data](https://www.google.com/publicdata). The software features an animated scatter plot where the data points represent the countries of the world, the axes can be set to any combination of development indicators and the points animate through time. The data is also available in line and bar charts as well as a map view. **The goal of Polyplot is to be the best data exploration software in the world, basically a better and sexier version of Google Public Data!**

The application uses [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) on the frontend and is powered by [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) and [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) as well as a few smaller libraries and gists. In addition to the visual exploration software Polyplots backend uses [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and features automatic data updates as well as an [API](https://github.com/jgphilpott/polyplot/blob/master/docs/api/README.md) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jgphilpott/polyplot/blob/master/docs/notes/README.md) container, so you can easily tap into the data for your own creative purposes. **For a more complete list of features and highlights take a look [here](https://github.com/jgphilpott/polyplot/blob/master/docs/features/README.md).**
